Architecture rules:
- Organize code by feature, not by file type
- Group components, logic, and API related to a feature together
- Avoid large shared folders with unrelated logic
- Keep cross-feature shared code minimal and explicit
- Use clear, consistent naming for features and folders
- Prefer kebab-case for files and directories
