Data fetching rules:
- Fetch data on the server whenever possible
- Prefer server-side data fetching over client-side
- Use client-side fetching only for highly interactive features
- Avoid unnecessary global state
- Keep state local when possible
- Do not mix data fetching logic directly inside UI components
