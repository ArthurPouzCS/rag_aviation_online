description: Next.js App Router conventions
alwaysApply: true
---

This project uses Next.js with the App Router.

Rules:
- Use the `app/` directory exclusively
- Prefer Server Components by default
- Use Client Components only when required for interactivity
- Mark Client Components explicitly with `"use client"`
- Use async Server Components for data fetching
- Do not use `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps`
- Use `app/api` for backend routes
