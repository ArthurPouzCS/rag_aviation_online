description: API routes and validation standards
alwaysApply: true

API rules:
- All API routes must validate input using Zod
- Validate both request payloads and responses when applicable
- Never trust client input
- Keep API handlers thin
- Move business logic into separate functions or services
- Return consistent and predictable response shapes
