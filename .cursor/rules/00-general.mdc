You are working on a production Next.js application.

General rules:
- Use TypeScript everywhere
- Prioritize clarity, readability, and maintainability
- Follow existing project conventions strictly
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions or premature optimization
- Do not introduce new libraries without clear justification
- Never guess requirements; ask if something is unclear
