Component rules:
- One React component per file
- Prefer small, focused components
- Use functional components only
- Use named exports (no default exports)
- Keep UI components free of business logic
- Extract reusable UI patterns into shared components

Styling:
- Use Tailwind CSS exclusively for styling
- Avoid inline styles
- Avoid custom CSS unless strictly necessary
